        <h2 class="header">Services</h2>
        <p>We are located in the newly renovated <span class="italic">SPARC-Up Fitness</span> gym 
        in Brooklyn Park, a private facility that is free from the noise and traffic of a 
        commercial gym. We have adaptive devices that transform ordinary gym equipment into a
        disability-friendly training space.</p>
        <h3>Hydrotherapy</h3>
        <p>We provide personalised one-on-one hydrotherapy sessions at the Minda Rehabilitation Pool 
          in Brighton.</p>
        <p>
          We offer a variety of delivery options depending on the client's capability and 
          funding. Options range from weekly physio to 4-6 weekly oversight, with sessions delivered 
          by an Allied Health Assistant or the client's support workers.
        </p>
        <h3>In-home visits</h3>
        <p>We provide in-home visits for clients who are unable to make it to our clinic.</p>
        <p>Our services  include physiotherapy assessment, manual therapy and home-based exercise 
          prescribed for the client's capability, goals and condition.</p>
        <h3>Other services:</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Transition care plan and support worker training</li>
          <li>Comprehensive falls assessments</li>
          <li>Physiotherapy reports</li>

        <h2 class="header">For Support Coordinators</h2>
        <p>We work closely with our support coordinators, providing regular updates on the client's 
          progress, functional decline or change of circumstances to ensure you are up-to-date with 
          their needs and any changes that occur.</p>
        <p>We are aware that many of our clients do not want to access a commercial gym that is busy 
          and noisy. We offer a unique training environment that is not accessible to the general 
          public. Clients are also encouraged to train at home, or in their own gym, and are supported 
          with an application that provides them with all their exercises and tracks their progress.</p>
        <p>We would love to talk with you about the unique services we offer.</p>
        <h3>We work with clients who have a diagnosis of:</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Cerebral palsy</li>
          <li>Spinal cord injury</li>
          <li>Down syndrome</li>
          <li>Multiple sclerosis</li>
